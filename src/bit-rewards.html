          *Sent to your crypto wallet.*

          Own a part of **Locus** in its earliest phase with every [crypto contribution](#support), as an Artifact `NFT` edition of the **Locus** concept art, sent to your wallet.

          Each Artifact is an [`NFT` crypto asset](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x20cddf283164ee59742c80aa5ce9b97127f123ce/145){target="_blank"} – its value may grow with the project and its community, and can be traded on the blockchain.

          Your Artifacts give you a voice to curate projects for Artizen funding seasons – each grants you a vote you can give to projects you believe in and would like to give the chance to be funded on Artizen.
        </section>
        <section md>
          Ownership also grants you access to private communities of:
          - **Locus:** backers, team members; shaping the project, insights, progress, exhibitions, events, connecting collectors with art.
          - **Artizen:** curators, creators, supporters; meeting online and at events around the world, driving positive-impact projects.

          Artifact collectors will be connected to the final artwork, as sponsors credited by name or brand or alias, and by unlocking extra features of **Locus**.

        #### 2 × Tier ~ a ***Peer into the flow*** edition

          *Sent to your crypto wallet.*

          For every **2 Artifacts** you buy via [crypto](#support), your wallet also receives a <span class="info" title="This reward's edition is minted randomly, but you can also buy one you choose specifically on Olta or OpenSea.">random unique `NFT` edition</span> of [Peer into the flow](https://nft.olta.art/project/0x6d24ce4c32e556313b431fb156edf2060680a998){target="_blank"}, while this limited series of **66** lasts.

          Own an edition of these digital interactive kinetic sketches, exploring flowing forms and natural interactions with your look and touch, <span class="info" title="Each NFT edition's aesthetics respond to information from its blockchain network, reacting to its owner and how it and the collection are traded">evolving with their on-chain context</span>.

          Here your touch or cursor influence the particles, while the view mirrors the turn of your head with the [camera `AI` face-tracking enabled](#){.peer-camera-on}.
        </section>
        <section md>
          This series was created by [epok.tech](https://epok.tech){target="_blank"} to support **Locus** with sales to collectors, and to prototype some of its elements – `AI` body-tracking for natural interactions, complex motions of millions of particles.

          A random edition from the series for **2 Artifacts** – see it on [Olta](https://nft.olta.art/project/0x6d24ce4c32e556313b431fb156edf2060680a998){target="_blank"} or [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/peer-into-the-flow){target="_blank"} to learn about the series, interactions, controls, dynamic on-chain effects, and you can also choose a specific edition to mint directly at normal price.

          **Peer into the flow** collectors will see their editions dynamically update and connect with the final **Locus** artwork.

        #### 8 × Tier ~ a 3D face scan shown in *Locus*
        </section>
      </section>
      <section class="split">
        <section md>
          *No crypto wallet needed, provide your contact when contributing to set up this reward.*

          For every **8 Artifacts** you buy from **Locus**, a hyper-realistic 3D scan of your face will feature in the artwork.

          Using [`Gaussian Splatting`](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/){target="_blank"}, a new hyper-realistic 3D scanning technology, we'll process a video or images of your face at different angles to generate a physically-realistic 3D reconstruction.
        </section>
        <section md>
          Your 3D face-scan will then be integrated into the art as:
          - A unique digital artwork of your face, given to you as digital assets and optionally an `NFT` – soon after we receive your imagery.
          - One of many faces that fade through the **Locus** artwork while noone's interacting with it – when the final artwork is exhibited.

          This uses the same technique as in the final **Locus** artwork – to reflect your likeness faithfully in the visuals, mirror you and deepen your personal connection with your experience, and gather an archive of all the varied participants and supporters of this project.
