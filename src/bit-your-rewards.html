    ### Your Rewards

    You can earn rewards for supporting the **Locus** project – each unlocked in tiers for every <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[1×](#reward-artifact) or [2×](#reward-peer) or [3×](#reward-face) Artifacts</span> that you buy.

    *Some rewards can only be sent to you if you have a crypto wallet.*
    <br/>
    *Some rewards require further information like your email or photos.*

          #### 1×Artifact ~ A *Locus Artifact* edition

          *Pay by [crypto](#contribute) ~ must be sent to your wallet.*

          Own a part of **Locus** in its earliest phase with every [crypto contribution](#contribute), as an Artifact `NFT` edition of the **Locus** concept art, sent to your wallet.

          Each Artifact is an [`NFT` crypto asset](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x20cddf283164ee59742c80aa5ce9b97127f123ce/145){target="_blank"} – its value may grow with the project and its community, and can be traded on the *blockchain*.

          Your Artifacts give you a voice to curate projects for Artizen funding seasons – each grants you a vote you can give to projects you believe in and would like to give the chance to be funded on Artizen.
        </section>
        <section md>
          Ownership also grants you access to private communities of:
          - **Locus:** backers, team members; shaping the project, insights, progress, exhibitions, events, connecting collectors with art.
          - **Artizen:** curators, creators, supporters; meeting online and at events around the world, driving positive-impact projects.

          Artifact collectors will be connected to the final artwork, as sponsors credited by name or brand or alias, and by unlocking extra features of **Locus**.

          *Pay by [crypto](#contribute) ~ must be sent to your wallet.*

          For every **2 Artifacts** you buy via [crypto](#contribute), your wallet also receives a <span class="info" title="This reward's edition is minted randomly, but you can also buy one you choose specifically on Olta or OpenSea.">random unique `NFT` edition</span> of [Peer into the Flow](https://nft.olta.art/project/0x6d24ce4c32e556313b431fb156edf2060680a998){target="_blank"}, while this limited series of **66** lasts.

          Own an edition of these digital interactive kinetic sketches, exploring flowing forms and natural interactions with your look and touch, <span class="info" title="Each NFT edition's aesthetics respond to information from its blockchain network, reacting to its owner and how it and the collection are traded">evolving with their on-chain context</span>.

          Here your touch or cursor influence the particles, while the view mirrors the turn of your head with the [`AI` face-tracking camera enabled](#){.peer-camera-on}.
        </section>
        <section md>
          This series was created by [epok.tech](https://epok.tech){target="_blank"} to support **Locus** with sales to collectors, and to prototype some of its elements – `AI` body-tracking for natural interactions, complex motions of millions of particles.

          A free random edition from **2 Artifacts** at [`Ξ0.02 / 52MATIC`{.info title="0.02ETH (Ether), about 52MATIC (Polygon Matic)" data-coin-at=eth data-coin-to=matic data-coin-sum="0.02" data-coin-text="()([0-9\\.]+)(MATIC)" data-coin-title="()([0-9\\.]+)(MATIC)"}](https://whitebit.com/convert/ETH/MATIC?direction=give&amount=0.02){target="_blank"} is discounted from [`Ξ0.04 / 92MATIC`{.info title="92MATIC (Polygon Matic), about 0.04ETH (Ether)" data-coin-at=matic data-coin-to=eth data-coin-sum="92" data-coin-text="(Ξ)([0-9\\.]+)()" data-coin-title="()([0-9\\.]+)(ETH)" data-coin-place="2"}](https://whitebit.com/convert/MATIC/ETH?direction=give&amount=92){target="_blank"}.
          See it on [Olta](https://nft.olta.art/project/0x6d24ce4c32e556313b431fb156edf2060680a998){target="_blank"} or [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/peer-into-the-flow){target="_blank"} to learn about the series, interactions, controls, dynamic on-chain effects, and specify an edition to mint (at full price).

          **Peer into the Flow** collectors will see their editions dynamically update and connect with the final **Locus** artwork.

        #### 3×Artifact ~ A 3D face scan shown in *Locus*
        </section>
      </section>
      <section class="split">
        <section md>
          ***Coming Soon** ~ this reward will apply retroactively when released.*
          <br/>
          *No wallet needed ~ pay by [crypto or card](#contribute) and add your email.*
          <br/>
          *Further information required ~ [contact us](#contact) to set up this reward.*

          For every **3 Artifacts** you buy from **Locus**, a hyper-realistic 3D scan of your face will feature as artwork!

          Using an exciting new technology, [`Gaussian Splatting`](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/){target="_blank"}, we'll process a video or several images of your face at different angles, to generate a physically-realistic 3D reconstruction.
        </section>
        <section md>
          Your 3D face-scan will then be integrated into the art as:
          - A unique digital artwork of your face, given to you as digital assets and optionally an `NFT` – soon after we receive your imagery.
          - One of many faces that fade through the **Locus** artwork while nobody's interacting with it – when the final artwork is exhibited.

          This is the same technique to be used in the final **Locus** artwork, to reflect to you faithfully, in near-real-time.
