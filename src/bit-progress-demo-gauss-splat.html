    ### Progress demo ~ `Gaussian-Splatting`

    Adapting `Gaussian-Splatting` with custom real-time rendering and animation, to integrate hyper-realistic 3D face models of audiences directly into the **Locus** artwork.

    This will reflect your likeness faithfully in the visuals, mirror you and deepen your personal connection with your experience, and gather an archive of all the varied participants and supporters of this project.

    <small md>
      Using [`Gaussian Splatting`](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/){target="_blank"}, a new hyper-realistic 3D scanning technology, we'll process a video or images of your face at different angles to generate a physically-realistic 3D reconstruction,integrated into the artwork.
