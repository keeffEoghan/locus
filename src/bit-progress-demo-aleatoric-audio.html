    ### Progress demo ~ aleatoric immersive audio

    Exploring and prototyping the aleatoric audio process – it will be driven by the emergent fluid motions of millions of particles, each individual influence accumulated to generate a collective sound, played across many-channel audio enclosing the space and immersing the audience.

    [Morgan Carparelli](https://ocelotsound.com/){target="_blank"} – the sound-engineer for **Locus**, coming from the world of high-end film, television, and game audio – is iterating this concept into this early prototype, where many spatialised audio sources are driven along parametric curves and synths are driven by overlapping inputs.

      This prototype is built with `Iannix`, `Reaper`, and `PureData` – to be ported into `JavaScript`, `WebAudio`, and `WebGL` as we progress the audio process and musical qualities.
