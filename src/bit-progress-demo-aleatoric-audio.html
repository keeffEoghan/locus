    [Morgan Carparelli](https://ocelotsound.com/){target="_blank"}, sound-engineer for **Locus**, established in [high-end film, TV, and game audio](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4418437/){target="_blank"}, iterated this idea to develop an initial prototype in `Iannix`, `Reaper`, and `PureData` â€“ to be ported into `JavaScript`, `WebAudio`, and `WebGL` as we progress the audio process and musical qualities.
