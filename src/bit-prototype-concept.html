    ### Concept

    [Hand-drawn concept art sketches](https://youtu.be/bS0p8n_VcEY){target="_blank"} exploring each aspect of the artwork aesthetic.

    In this demo we explore the concept layer by layer – slide across it to peel through and expand:
    - the surface of the bust reflecting your own appearance
    - the translucent anatomical forms visible throughout and within
    - the anatomy blended with fluid particles matching their colours
    - the flowing particles alone tracing just hints of the anatomy

    Following these are AI-generated variations, exploring a wider space of diverse potential aesthetics.

    This concept emerged from my own experiences with meditation – the process and practice expressed allegorically to evoke similar experiences in me and others.<br/>
    I set out from this point with the aim of engaging other people in an experience which helped me establish a resilient foundation and balanced outlook in my life – expressed wordlessly and experientially, directly subjective not prescriptively descriptive.
