    ### Progress demo ~ *Peer into the Flow*

    Work-in-progress developing `GPU` particle simulation and rendering and `AI` face-tracking technology for **Locus**.

    Here your touch or cursor influence the particles, while the view mirrors the turn of your head with the [`AI` face-tracking camera enabled](#){.peer-camera-on}.

    This work was also released as an `NFT` series of editions on [Olta](https://nft.olta.art/project/0x6d24ce4c32e556313b431fb156edf2060680a998){target="_blank"} to raise collector funds for **Locus** development.

    Integrates [`gl-gpgpu`](https://epk.tech/gl-gpgpu){target="_blank"} to simulate all the physics and several other aspects, while supporting `WebGL 1.0` for equity of access on many devices.

    Integrates [`AI` face-tracking](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/studio/demo/face_landmarker){target="_blank"} for natural-motion interaction via camera to control the viewpoint.
