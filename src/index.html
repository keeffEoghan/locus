          ## *Locus* is an interactive digital artwork

          Aiming to engage audiences in **direct participatory experiences** evoking meditation, it will be exhibited as a physical installation, a free online experience, and an `NFT`{.info title="Non-Fungible Token, a cryptocurrency asset"} series of editions.

          As flowing particles trace layers in a translucent human form, the audience and artwork interact by natural motion to co-create a meditative experience.

          <small>*To explore aspects of the artwork, you can scroll down, turn and zoom the 3D scene, and open the points highlighted with "**+**".*</small>

          ### Aesthetic and concept

          Millions of *particles in fluid motion* pass through a *translucent human bust* â€“ their colours match the forms they flow within (*skin, bone, muscle, organs*), tracing ephemeral hints of shapes and colours layered into the depths.

          Observing this fluid motion elicits a meditation on our own subjective sensations (*bodily, thought, emotional*) â€“ each dynamic, interconnected, chaotic processes.

          <small>*Meditation can't be truly be known conceptually or discursively, only by **direct participatory experience**, here enabled by **interactive digital media** â€“ real-time visuals, motion, and sound.*</small>

          <small>*The bust's face matches yours, using a hyper-realistic 3D facial scan via [`Gaussian Splatting`](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/){target="_blank"} technology.*</small>

          ### Interaction by natural motion

          Your natural motions affect the flow â€“ *movement agitates it into turbulent flurries*, clouding outer surfaces; *stillness settles it into smooth filaments*, revealing intricate details of inner depths.

          In this way the artwork reveals itself by your still mindful reflection, in contrast to busy activity â€“ as *still water's clearer than an agitated surface*, you see more deeply within.

          <small>*Your body's intuitive motion affects the artwork via its camera:*</small>

          ### Sound composed dynamically for immersion

          Spatial audio is *generated in real-time by each particle's motion* â€“ individual particle sounds culminate into an immersive collective sound; *as the sound of wind moving a leaf is to that of a forest*.

          Dynamically generating sound driven by the *emergent* motions of millions of interacting particles is an experimental process â€“ we'll explore the potential of *procedural audio* and aim to create *aleatoric music*.

          ### Exhibited in complementary interacting formats

          ***Physical Installation:*** The main exhibit; a projection on a large circular screen, camera participants interact with, wider area for observers, and spatial audio system for immersive sound.

          ***Online Digital:*** The experience can be explored anywhere by anyone on their own web devices for free, supporting equity of access to the artwork.

          ***`NFT` Series:***{.info title="Non-Fungible Token, a cryptocurrency asset"} Editions across the artwork's range of aesthetics and themes; *driven by on-chain data*{.info title="Each NFT edition responds to information from its blockchain network, responding to its owner and how it and the collection are traded"} and collectors' input. Early supporters and installation attendees earn rewards that interact with these `NFT`{.info title="Non-Fungible Token, a cryptocurrency asset"} editions.

            #### What you get

            [*Locus* rewards you](#your-rewards) for your support, both right now and in the future integrated into the final artwork.

            Each *Artifact* is an [`NFT` asset](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x20cddf283164ee59742c80aa5ce9b97127f123ce/145){.info title="Non-Fungible Token, a cryptocurrency asset" target="_blank"} that benefits both you and the project.

            [Your *Artifacts* are investments in *Locus*](https://help.artizen.fund/en/articles/6746680-artifacts-are-an-investment-in-positive-impact){target="_blank"}, a stake whose worth grows with the project and its community.

            The *Artifacts* you own also [grant you access](https://help.artizen.fund/en/articles/6761187-artifacts-unlock-a-vibrant-community){target="_blank"} to private *Locus* and *Artizen* communities, and [votes to curate](https://help.artizen.fund/en/articles/6781958-how-to-curate-projects){target="_blank"} future *Artizen* seasons.

                Each *Artifact* is an [`NFT` crypto asset](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x20cddf283164ee59742c80aa5ce9b97127f123ce/145){.info title="Non-Fungible Token, a cryptocurrency asset" target="_blank"} â€“ its value may grow with the project and its community, and can be traded on the *blockchain*.

                Your *Artifacts* give you a voice to curate projects for *Artizen* funding seasons â€“ each grants you a vote you can give to projects you believe in and would like to give the chance to be funded on *Artizen*.

                Ownership also grants you access to private communities of:

                - *Artizen*: curators, creators, supporters; meeting online and at events around the world, driving positive-impact projects.

                *Artifact* collectors will be connected to the final artwork, as sponsors credited by name or brand or alias, and by unlocking extra features of *Locus*.

                Own an edition of these digital interactive kinetic sketches, exploring flowing forms and natural interactions with your look and touch, evolving with their on-chain context.

                *Peer into the Flow* collectors will see their editions dynamically update and connect with the final *Locus* artwork.

                For every *3* *Artifacts* you buy from *Locus*, a hyper-realistic 3D scan of your face will feature as artwork!

                Using an exciting new technology, [`Gaussian Splatting`](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/){target="_blank"}, we'll process a video or several images of your face at different angles, to generate a physically-realistic 3D reconstruction.
              </section>
              <section md>
                Your 3D face-scan will then be integrated into the art as:
                - A unique digital artwork of your face, given to you as digital assets and optionally an `NFT`{.info title="Non-Fungible Token, a cryptocurrency asset"} - *soon after we receive your imagery*.
                - One of many faces that fade through the *Locus* artwork while nobody's interacting with it - *when the final artwork is exhibited*.

                This is the same technique to be used in the final *Locus* artwork, to reflect to you faithfully, in near-real-time.
