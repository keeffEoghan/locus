      ### Milestones reached

      We've deeply researched key elements:
      - `Material Point Method` for physics realism, in real-time web-tech on `GPU`, with the advice of leading academic researcher Raymond Yun Fei PhD.
      - `Signed-Distance Fields` for the anatomical bust 3D forms to influence fluid particles' colour and matter properties; and related methods.

      Developed `Optical-Flow`, `AI` face-tracking, `GPU`-optimised real-time simulation elements, splitting parts into smaller projects supporting this main artwork.

      Completed the detailed production timeline and budget.
