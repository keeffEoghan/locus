      ### Team and partners

      We've assembled talented people into a multi-disciplinary creative team to bring this project to life:
      - Creative Consultant, Technical Producer, Designers, Photographers, Public Engagement Consultant.
      - Sound-Designer and Musician collaborating on experimental generative sound.
      - Steel & Form metalwork studio for set-design and fabrication.
      - Innovation Creative Director support by Amplify creative agency.
      - Meditation Consultant, interviewing other meditative practitioners and audiences to keep this artistic interpretation authentic.

      ### Milestones reached

      We've deeply researched key elements:
      - `Material Point Method` for physics realism, in real-time web-tech on `GPU`, with the advice of leading academic researcher Raymond Yun Fei PhD.
      - `Signed-Distance Fields` for the anatomical bust 3D forms to influence fluid particles' colour and matter properties; and related methods.

      Developed `optical-flow`, `AI` face-tracking, `GPU`-optimised real-time simulation elements, splitting parts into smaller projects supporting this main artwork:
      - **[Peer into the Flow](https://nft.olta.art/project/0x6d24ce4c32e556313b431fb156edf2060680a998){target="_blank"}:** `NFT` series of sketches editions on Olta; using `AI` face-tracking interaction to control the viewpoint; and optimised `GPU` simulation and rendering; with development and proceeds supporting this artwork.
      - **[`Optical-flow` interaction](https://epok.tech/glsl-optical-flow){target="_blank"}:** developed natural-motion interaction, for participants' movements to directly influence the particle flow.

      Completed the detailed production timeline and budget.
