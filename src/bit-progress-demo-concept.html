    ### Progress demo ~ concept

    [Hand-drawn concept art sketches](https://youtu.be/bS0p8n_VcEY){target="_blank"} exploring each aspect of the artwork aesthetic.

    In this demo we explore the concept layer by layer.<br/>
    First, the outer bust surface, then the translucent inner anatomy, then blended with fluid particles flowing through and matching anatomical colours, finally the flowing particles alone tracing hints of anatomy forms.<br/>
    Following these are AI-generated variations, exploring a diversity of potential aesthetics to widen the explored space.

    This concept emerged from my own experiences with meditation – the process and practice as I experience it, expressed allegorically in a way that evokes similar feelings in me.<br/>
    I set out from this point with the aim of engaging other people in an experience which helped me establish a resilient foundation and balanced outlook in my life – expressed wordlessly and experientially, directly subjective not prescriptively descriptive.
